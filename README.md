# [Bedrock](http://roots.io/wordpress-stack/)

Bedrock is a modern WordPress stack that helps you get started with the best development tools and project structure.

Bedrock's main features:

* Dependency management with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
* Automated deployments with [Capistrano](http://www.capistranorb.com/)
* Easy development environments with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) - coming soon!
* Better folder structure
* Easy WordPress configuration with environment specific files

Bedrock is meant as a base for you to fork and modify to fit your needs. It is delete-key friendly and you can strip out or modify any part of it. You'll also want to customize Bedrock with settings specific to your sites/company.

Note: While this is a project from the guys behind the [Roots starter theme](http://roots.io/starter-theme), Bedrock isn't tied to Roots in any way and works with any theme.

* PHP >= 5.3.2 (for Composer)
